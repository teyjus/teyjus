#summary a tutorial introduction to Teyjus

= A Tutorial Introduction to Programming Using the Teyjus System =

_While a tutorial with the following outline is planned, it does not currently exist.  The best source of information on how to use Teyjus can be found in the appendix of the book [https://sites.google.com/site/proghol/ "Programming with Higher-Order Logic"]._

This wiki will assume a knowledge of Prolog and then will

   * step the reader through the process of translating simple Prolog programs to Teyjus syntax

   * exhibit some of the higher-order features

   * motivate the use of higher-order abstract syntax in manipulating objects whose structure involves binding

   * explain the intended paradigm for the modularity constructs, especially accumulation, the role of signatures and the purpose of _exportdef_ and _useonly_ annotations
