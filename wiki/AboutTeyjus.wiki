#summary A Brief Description of the Teyjus System and Project

= Teyjus - An Implementation of Lambda Prolog =

The name "Teyjus" is used interchangeably for a family of systems and a project that are about providing an efficient and robust implementation of the language [http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Dale.Miller/lProlog/ Lambda Prolog]. As a system, Teyjus has seen two incarnations. Its first version, released in mid-1999, was implemented entirely in C and supported full higher-order unification. Its second version, released in April 2008, is implemented in a mixture of C and OCaml and is oriented around a special form of higher-order unification known as pattern unification. As a project, Teyjus has spanned a period of over a decade, involving, at various times, people from Duke University, SUNY Buffalo, the University of Chicago and the University of Minnesota; while the "project" was named only around 2000, its theme existed even earlier, and the system that exists today reflects the cumulative result of all their efforts. 

The various links below provide more information about different aspects of Teyjus as a system and as a project.
