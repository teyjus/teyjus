#summary A description of Teyjus program syntax

= The Syntax of Teyjus Programs =

The syntax of programs in _Teyjus_ is described by first identifying the composition of various kinds of tokens and then using these to present the syntax of signatures and modules, the main units of programming. We do not explain the meanings of programs here, assuming a prior exposure on the part of the reader to logic programming syntax and, further, a knowledge on their part of the manner in which the core language of _Lambda Prolog_ extends that of _Prolog_. We focus instead on the less common modularity aspects, explaining these, for example, through a commentary accompanying the signature and module syntax.
