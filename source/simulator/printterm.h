 *                                                                          *
 * File printterm.h{c}. This file contains routines for printing out lambda *
 * terms. It is assumed that these routines will be needed in two           *
 * situations: printing out answers to queries and displaying terms as      *
 * needed by invocation of builtin goals.                                   *
 * The difference between these two situations is in the display of         *
 * free term variables. Only when displaying answers is an attempt made to  *
 * present these using sensible names: in this case, either the name in the *
 * query is used or a concise name is cooked up. In the other situation,    *
 * the address of the variable cell is used as the name.                    *
 *                                                                          *
 * Certain assumptions are relevant to avoiding name clashes. For local     *
 * constants, the assumption is that no constant names in user              *
 * programs begin with <lc- and end with >. The use of this idea is         *
 * buried inside the routine PRINT_writeHCName.                             *
 * Violation of this condition is *not* checked. For term variables, the    *
 * assumption is that bound variables do not begin with _.                  *
 *                                                                          *
