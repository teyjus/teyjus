 *  The script that follows shows the execution of the code that implements  *
 *  tail recursion recognition for two argument functional programs. The     *
 *  script is a little cryptic. Looking at the relevant module will reveal   *
 *  that the (tail recursive) factorial and gcd programs are deemed to be    *
 *  tail recursive as expected but the append program is not so recognized.  *
 *  This code demonstrates the power/usefulness of higher-order unification. *
 *                                                                           *
 *  The module tr1_test is assumed to be precompiled in this script.         *
 *                                                                           *
